In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic framework **RLMRec** that enhances existing recommenders with LLM-empowered representation learning. It proposes a paradigm that integrates representation learning with LLMs to capture intricate semantic aspects of user behaviors and preferences. RLMRec incorporates auxiliary textual signals, develops a user/item profiling paradigm empowered by LLMs, and aligns the semantic space of LLMs with the representation space of collaborative relational signals through a cross-view alignment framework.
